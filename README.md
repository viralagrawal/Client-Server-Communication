# Client-Server-Communication
Client Sever Communcation using RN-171-EK Wi-Fi module and LPC1769 microcontroller.
The Interfacing of LPC1769 and Wi-Fi module act as a Client and a Server is created on a different location. 
The data is send to the Wi-Fi through the UART of the LPC1769 to the UART of the Wi-Fi module, the module than send the data to the server, the server receives the data and send back the acknowledgement to the client. 
This help to communicate between client and Server using the UART protocol.
